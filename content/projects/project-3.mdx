## Challenge

A professional tarot card reader needed a website that would showcase her services, allow clients to book sessions online, and process payments securely. She wanted a mystical yet professional design that would appeal to her target audience.

## Strategy

I developed a comprehensive website strategy that included:

- Custom website design with mystical elements and professional layout
- Online booking system with calendar integration
- Secure payment processing for session bookings
- Testimonials and service descriptions
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go bookings

## Implementation

The website was developed in phases:

1. Phase 1: Design and development of core website
2. Phase 2: Integration of booking system and calendar
3. Phase 3: Implementation of payment processing and testing

## Results

The website launch delivered impressive results:

- 150% increase in monthly bookings
- 80% of bookings now made online (previously phone-only)
- 35% increase in average session value
- Expanded client base to new geographic areas
- Reduced administrative work by 10 hours per week
