## Challenge

An established e-learning platform needed a complete website redesign to improve user experience and incorporate interactive course features. They wanted a system that would allow easy management of students, courses, and learning materials.

## Strategy

I developed a comprehensive website strategy that included:

- Complete website redesign with improved UX/UI and mobile optimization
- Interactive course platform with progress tracking
- Student management system with user profiles
- Content management system for easy updates
- Payment integration for course purchases

## Implementation

The implementation was phased over 3 months:

1. Phase 1: Research, strategy development, and website design
2. Phase 2: Development of core website and CMS
3. Phase 3: Implementation of course platform and student management system

## Results

The website redesign delivered exceptional results:

- 200% increase in course enrollments
- 156% increase in website traffic
- 45% improvement in user engagement
- 320% growth in mobile users
- 28% reduction in course abandonment rate
